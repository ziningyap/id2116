   <p class="top">For our selected object, we decided to use the umbrella! The actions we have identified for the umbrella are as follows: <br><br>
   <div class="container">

  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/kMg7NGS/umbrellaclose.jpg" style = "width: 250px;">

</div>
    <div class= "label">| opening | closing | spinning |</div>
 </body>

 <div class="microbit">
   <p class="bottom">
  In order to use the spinning action as a trigger, we want to track the change in angle of rotation of the umbrella. We thought that the accelerometer is unable to accurately track the type of planar rotation of the umbrella. Hence, we tried to use the microbit’s compass heading to track the angle changed.

<p class="bottom2">
  However, as the microbit is limited to 360 degrees and is itself a fixed compass, the degree is dependent on the position of microbit rather than amount of rotation.
