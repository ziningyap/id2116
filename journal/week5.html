   <p class="top">This week, we looked into coding our p5.js so that the right video <br> will appear with their corresponding triggers for the individual key video states.        <br>
     
     <br><br>Our key video states had to include the following functions: 

     <br>
     <b> 
       
     + Videos appearing and playing
     <br> + Videos hidden and paused
     <br> + Videos at normal speed vs sped up
       
     </b>

   </p>
   <p class="top2">All whilst following the condition that there is smooth transition from each video state to another through the assigned trigger actions and that only one video would be playing at a time.</p>

   <p class="top2">Controlling two separate videos concurrently <br> using two different sensors → setting two separate conditions so they can run concurrently.</p>

  We got started on connecting the microbit's collected data and p5.js together through the bluetooth uart service. Our initial plan was to gather brightness and acceleration data from the microbit and translate these numbers to our intended functions on p5.js
   </p>

  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 70%;">
  
<p class="bottom2">
  <br>However, we kept facing the same microbit error 020 when we tried to read the brightness and acceleration data together :-( Apparently, this was too complex or contained a lot of large variables for the microbit. It is able to write line for a single individual input data though.
