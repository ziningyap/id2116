<div class="weeknumber">— 05 —</div>
   <p class="top">This week, we looked into coding our p5.js so that the right video will appear <br> with their corresponding triggers for the individual key video states.        <br>
     
     <br><br>Our key video states had to include the following functions: 

     <br>
     <b> 
       
     + Videos appearing and playing
     <br> + Videos hidden and paused
     <br> + Videos at normal speed vs sped up
       
     </b>
     </p>

   <p class="top2">All whilst following the condition that there is smooth transition from each video state to another through the <br> assigned trigger actions and that only one video would be playing at a time.</p>

 <div class="microbit">
   <p class="bottom">
     To simplify the data that is sent from the microbit to p5, we decided to have the data read on microbit and converted to a fixed response (i.e. “dim). Less data is required to be sent over through the bluetooth UART service, allowing us to solve the previous 020 error.
