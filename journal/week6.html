   <p class="top">Through further testing, we realised there is a possibility of the accelerometer getting detected even when the umbrella is closed. This would then trigger the wrong video, disrupting our video sequencing. Hence, we altered our microbit’s code so that it will play the blending video only when the umbrella is open.

Some concerns we have with the microbit code initially was how extreme the acceleration value could fluctuate. This is not ideal since the videos will constantly toggle between each other, causing it to be very choppy!!

  Unfortunately, this new input of data is apparently too much for the microbit again so we were faced with the same error 020 again :-( Moreover, we also realised the brightness and acceleration values are still clashing with one another. This resulted in a choppy back-and-forth switch between videos. Hence, we tried to incorporate both values into our conditions.

  Upon testing, we discovered that the blending video toggles back to the launching video after the umbrella stops spinning. Since it wouldn't make sense for the fruit that is already blended to transition back to being launched, we added a condition to our p5 code. This helps to ensure that the launching video does not play again after the umbrella stops spinning.
