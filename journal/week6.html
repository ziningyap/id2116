   <p class="top">Through further testing, we realised there is a possibility of the accelerometer getting detected even when the umbrella is closed. This would then trigger the wrong video, disrupting our video sequencing. Hence, we altered our microbit’s code so that it will play the blending video only when the umbrella is open.

Some concerns we have with the microbit code initially was how extreme the acceleration value could fluctuate. This is not ideal since the videos will constantly toggle between each other, causing it to be very choppy!!

   <p class="bottom"><br><br>To solve this issue of a fluctuating acceleration reading, Yuta suggested the introduction of a new variable! This helps us to map the acceleration values so that the change is smoother and more stable.</p>

  Unfortunately, this new input of data is apparently too much for the microbit again so we were faced with the same error 020 again :-( Moreover, we also realised the brightness and acceleration values are still clashing with one another. This resulted in a choppy back-and-forth switch between videos. Hence, we tried to incorporate both values into our conditions.
