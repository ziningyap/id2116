    <h1>Hi My name is Lewis</h1>
    <p>I am an aspiring Industrial Designer that is currently honing and developing my skills at the National University of Singapore (NUS). I believe in the need for self-expression and the awareness of feelings and thoughts. This is because with the understanding of emotions and thought processes, we would be able to design for more than merely the superficial needs of people. To be able to connect on an emotional level with users, is the greatest fulfilment beyond appeal and acceptance of a design.</p>
 
    <h2>My strengthes as a designer are...</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>Being empathetic</li>
       <li>That I am flexible</li>
       <li>An inquisitive spirit</li>
       <li>I am jolly</li>
     </ul>
