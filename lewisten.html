     I am an aspiring Industrial Designer that is currently honing and developing my skills at NUS. I believe in the need for self-expression and the awareness of feelings and thoughts. <br> Understanding of emotions and thought processes helps me design for more than merely the superficial needs of people. To go through hearing the stories of others and designing to see more than smiles!
