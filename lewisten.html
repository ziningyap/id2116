     <p>I am an aspiring Industrial Designer that is currently <br>honing and developing my skills at NUS.<br> I believe in the need for self-expression<br> and the awareness of feelings and thoughts. <br>Understanding of emotions and thought processes <br>helps me design for more than <br>merely the superficial needs of people. <br>To see more than smiles, <br> that's what makes me happy!</p>
    </div>
     <h2 class=strengths>MY STRENGTHS AS A DESIGNER ARE

      <ul>
        <li>Being empathetic</li>
        <li>That I am flexible</li>
        <li>An inquisitive spirit</li>
        <li>I am jolly</li>
      </ul>
